In the video, I actually demo all scripts created for this assignment. If you can't make it out,
you may have to manually increase the quality. It should be available in 1080p.


The animation script will bouce supplied text around the screen, or just an 'O' if nothing is given to it.


The adventure script is a simple text adventure game, not everything is perfect but it work well enough.
I will include the .sh files for all of these in the homework submission if possible, if not I will make
public github repo temporarily for the assignment.
